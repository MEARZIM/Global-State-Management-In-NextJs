This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
# NextJs Global State Management
This system built specifically for Next.js applications. Leveraging the power of the useContext hook, this system empowers developers to efficiently manage and share application-wide state without the complexity of prop drilling or third-party libraries. Whether you're building a small web app or a large-scale project, this solution provides a clean and scalable approach to state management.

## Installation

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
